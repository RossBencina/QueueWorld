    QwMpmcPopAllLifoStack is a lock-free concurrent LIFO stack that
    provides push() and pop_all()  operations. No single-node pop()
    operation is provided.

    All operations may be invoked concurrently.

    Implemented using the "IBM Freelist" LIFO algorithm.

    The algorithm doesn't need ABA protection because it does not provide a pop() operation.
    pop_all() is not subject to the ABA problem because it swaps in a nullptr value and never
    requires comparison to a non-nullptr value.
